# External benchmark manifests

These fixed manifests support `scripts/external_benchmarks.py`. They add one small targeted
dataset and one larger genome-wide dataset as **exploratory out-of-distribution diagnostics**,
not as independent validation of a classifier trained only on the repository simulations.

## Andean ducks (small)

The Dryad release for Graham et al. contains 10 low-elevation yellow-billed pintails (P1),
10 high-elevation pintails (P2), and 10 high-elevation speckled teal (P3). The beta-globin
panel is a published positive (D=0.78, fD=0.68), with ST-high -> YBP-high inferred in a
separate IMa2 analysis; alpha-globin is a published negative control (D=-0.04, P=0.477).
The actual quartet is `((YBP-high,YBP-low),(ST-high,ST-low))`, so this is explicitly also a
topology/domain-shift test rather than a clean match to the pectinate training tree.

## Scarlet runner bean (large)

The OSF VCF contains 237 samples. The manifest uses the authors' fixed relatedness exclusion
list and retains 8 Cult-TMVB-Spain, 19 Mexican Cult-TMVB, and 32 Wild-TMVB samples. The primary
orientation makes the Mexican cultivar the recipient (expected class C in the published
wild-to-crop context). Swapping the two sister cultivar populations makes Spain the putative
recipient and serves as a control: the paper's Spain demographic model has a bottleneck in the
absence of gene flow from wild populations. The direction head has no no-event class, so the
control is evaluated as a discordance/abstention diagnostic, not by demanding a null label.

The released provenance has a one-sample inconsistency that matters for exact comparison:
the canonical 183-sample metadata includes `FrijCol_11` and excludes `FrijCol_10`, whereas
several Dsuite scenario maps use `FrijCol_10` while still labelling the group n=19. This
manifest follows the canonical included set (`FrijCol_11`). It must not be described as a
verbatim replay of those Table S4 scenario files.

Exact URLs, byte sizes, hashes, citations, and the author-metadata commit are in `sources.json`.
Large VCFs and derived filtered VCFs remain ignored under `data/real/`.
